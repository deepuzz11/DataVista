## Project Development Steps

### 1. Set Up Project Environment

1. **Create a New Directory**:
   - Create a new directory in VS Code named `DataSage`.

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:
   - Initialize a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       .\venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On macOS/Linux:
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   - Install the necessary Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly scikit-learn tensorflow keras streamlit
     ```

### 2. Data Processing Module

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
  - Write Python scripts to handle data cleaning, transformation, and preparation for analysis.
  - Example script: `data_processing.py`.

### 3. Machine Learning Module

- **Model Development**:
  - Develop and train machine learning models for predictive analytics using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow/Keras.
  - Save the trained models to be used later in the dashboard.
  - Example script: `ml_model.py`.

### 4. Dashboard Development

- **Streamlit App**:
  - Create a Streamlit application to load and display the processed data.
  - Develop interactive visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib.
  - Integrate the machine learning models to provide predictive insights.
  - Example script: `app.py`.

### 5. Testing and Deployment

- **Testing**:
  - Test the application with various datasets to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
  
- **Deployment**:
  - Deploy the app using a platform like Heroku, Streamlit Sharing, or another cloud service.

### 6. Documentation

- **Documentation**:
  - Document the code and provide detailed usage instructions.
  - Create a user guide to help users navigate the dashboard and understand the insights.
